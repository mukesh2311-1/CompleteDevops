enkins Master-Slave Configuration
Key Topics Covered

1. Types of Jenkins Pipelines
* Two Main Types:
* Scripted Pipeline: Code written directly in Jenkins UI using Groovy language
* Declarative Pipeline: Code saved in SCM (Source Code Management like GitHub) as Jenkins file
* Two Additional Types:
* Multi-branch Pipeline: For handling multiple branches with separate CICD
* Shared Library Pipeline: Reusable code across multiple projects

2. Jenkins File Concept
* Jenkins file contains pipeline code (build, test, deploy stages)
* Saved in GitHub/SCM repository
* Called declaratively from Jenkins UI using "Pipeline script from SCM" option
* Jenkins automatically reads the file named "Jenkinsfile" from repository

3. Master-Slave Architecture - Main Focus
Why Master-Slave is Needed:
* Scenario 1: Performance team running heavy load tests can slow down entire Jenkins, affecting all teams
* Scenario 2: Multiple teams running jobs parallelly causes Jenkins slowness
* Solution: Create separate agents/nodes for different teams to distribute workload
Key Benefits:
* Master remains safe and unaffected
* Workload distributed across nodes
* If one node goes down, only that team is affected
* Security isolation between teams

4. Practical Implementation Steps

Part 1: Windows to Windows Configuration (Basic)
Step 1: Setup Jenkins Master (Windows)
* Install Jenkins on your local Windows machine
* Access Jenkins at localhost:8080
* Login with credentials (admin/admin as mentioned in session)
Step 2: Create Agent Node
* Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes
* Click "Add Node"
* Enter node name (e.g., "Performance-Prakash" or "dev")
* Select "Permanent Agent"
* Click Create
Step 3: Configure the Agent
* Set Remote Directory path (e.g., D:\dev\Jenkins-notes\Prakash)
* Create this folder structure on your Windows machine first
* Select "Launch agent by connecting to controller"
* Keep agent online as much as possible
* Save configuration
Step 4: Connect the Agent
* Click on the newly created node
* Copy the two commands provided:
* First command: Downloads agent.jar file using curl
* Second command: Runs the jar file with Java
* Open Command Prompt (CMD) in the remote directory location
* Execute both commands one by one
* Agent should show as connected (green status)
Step 5: Test the Configuration
* Create or configure a job
* In job configuration, use "Restrict where this project can be run"
* Specify the node label (dev or performance-prakash)
* Run the job and verify it executes on the specified node

Part 2: Jenkins Master on Ubuntu with CentOS Slave (Advanced Homework)
Requirements:
* Jenkins Master: Ubuntu/Linux machine (AWS or GCP)
* Slave Node 1: CentOS machine (same VPC, same subnet)
* Slave Node 2: Windows machine (optional, more complicated)
Key Points:
* Install Jenkins only on Master machine
* Install only Java on slave nodes (not Jenkins)
* If running Maven builds, install Maven on slave nodes or use plugins from master
* Use same connection process as Windows-to-Windows setup
* Configure agent with appropriate

Home Path for Windows
Windows :- C:\Users\Admin\.jenkins (war) Slave :- C:\Dev\jenkins-slave
C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins


Jenkins Pipeline Questions:
1. How many types of Jenkins pipeline are there?
Answer: Two major types - Declarative and Scripted pipeline
2. What is the difference between scripted and declarative pipeline?
Answer: Scripted pipeline - code is written directly in Jenkins UI. Declarative pipeline - code is saved in SCM (Source Code Management) and called from Jenkins UI via URL
3. What is Jenkins file?
Answer: It is a pipeline file saved in GitHub/SCM containing all the build, test, deploy steps and configurations. Since it's related to Jenkins, it's called Jenkins file.
4. Which pipeline type uses Jenkins file?
Answer: Declarative pipeline
5. What are the other types of pipelines apart from scripted and declarative?
Answer: Multi-branch pipeline and Shared library pipeline

Master-Slave Configuration Questions:
6. Why do we need master-slave configuration in Jenkins?
Answer: To distribute workload, prevent Jenkins from becoming slow, isolate different teams' work (like performance team), and avoid security issues
7. What is built-in node and why is it a security issue?
Answer: Built-in node is the master node. Running jobs on it is a security issue because if one team's work affects it, all teams get impacted
8. If a job is configured to run on a specific node and that node goes down, what happens?
Answer: The job will wait in pending state until the node comes back online
9. If no node is configured for a job, where will it run?
Answer: It will run on master (built-in node)
10. How do you troubleshoot when a Jenkins node goes down?
Answer: Check why machine is down (disk issue, CPU, memory, port conflict), fix the machine, then reconnect the agent by running the connection commands

Day-to-Day Activities Questions:
11. What are the day-to-day activities of Jenkins?
Answer: Upgrading Jenkins version, upgrading Java version, removing/upgrading vulnerable plugins, managing nodes, troubleshooting build failures, managing security issues
12. What happens when unit test cases run during build?
Answer: They are automatically executed.

Jenkins Pipeline Questions:
13. What are the types of Jenkins pipelines? (Answer: Scripted and Declarative)
14. What is the difference between scripted and declarative pipelines?
15. What is a Jenkins file and where is it stored?
16. What are multi-branch pipelines and when would you use them?
17. What is a shared library pipeline?

Master-Slave Configuration Questions:
6. Why do we need master-slave configuration in Jenkins?
7. What happens when a slave node goes down and a job is configured to run on that specific node?
8. How do you configure a Jenkins slave/agent node?
9. What is the built-in node and why is it a security concern to run jobs on it?
10. How do you troubleshoot when an agent is offline?
Jenkins Administration Questions:
11. What are the day-to-day activities of a Jenkins administrator?
12. How do you take backup of Jenkins configuration?
13. What is Jenkins home directory and what does it contain?
14. Explain the folder structure in Jenkins home directory (jobs, logs, nodes, plugins, secrets, users, workspace)
15. How many plugins are installed by default in Jenkins? (Answer: 100+ plugins)
Troubleshooting Questions:
16. What causes Jenkins to become slow?
17. How do you troubleshoot a failed Jenkins job?
18. What should you check in Manage Jenkins page for issues?
19. How do you handle plugin vulnerabilities in Jenkins?
20. What happens when Java version reaches end of life in Jenkins?
Configuration Questions:
21. What are common Jenkins job failure reasons?
22. How do you restrict a job to run on a specific agent?
23. What happens if no agent is configured for a job?
24. How do you handle long queue of Jenkins jobs?
