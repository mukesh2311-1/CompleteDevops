Jenkins Pipeline - Key Topics Covered
1. Jenkins Pipeline Introduction
* Transitioned from Freestyle projects to Pipeline projects
* Pipeline allows automation through code instead of manual UI configuration
* Uses Groovy language for scripting
* Reduces manual errors and provides better structure

2. Pipeline Structure
* Pipeline: Flow of stages and steps executed sequentially
* Stages: Major phases (e.g., Git Clone, Build, Deploy, Send Email)
* Steps: Individual commands within each stage
* Agent: Defines where the pipeline executes (any Jenkins server available)

3. Pipeline Syntax Generator
* Jenkins provides a built-in syntax generator tool
* Located in Pipeline Syntax section
* Helps generate correct code for Git, Shell scripts, Email, and other operations
* Eliminates manual syntax errors

4. Git Integration in Pipeline

* Public Repository: No credentials required
* Private Repository: Requires username/password credentials
* Syntax generator automatically creates proper Git commands with branch specifications

5. CI/CD Trigger Configuration
* Poll SCM: Cron expression for scheduled builds (e.g., * * * * * for every minute)
* Trigger Options: Can be configured via UI or pipeline code
* Only triggers when code changes are pushed to repository

6. Platform-Specific Differences
* Linux: Uses 'sh' command for shell scripts
* Windows: Uses 'bat' command for batch files, requires environment variable setup (PATH configuration)

7. Parameterized Builds
* Allows deployment to different environments (Dev, QA, Production)
* "Build with Parameters" option appears after configuration
* Reduces code duplication and manual errors

8. Post-Build Actions
* Upstream/Downstream Projects: Chain multiple jobs together
* CI job triggers CD job only when stable/successful
* Configured in "Post Build Action"

Basic Pipeline Setup:
1. Go to Jenkins dashboard
2. Click "New Item" or create a new job
3. Select "Pipeline" as the job type
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Pipeline1") and click OK

Writing Pipeline Code:
5. In the configuration page, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section
6. Select "Pipeline script" option
7. Write or paste your pipeline code with this structure:
* Start with "pipeline { }"
* Add "agent any"
* Create "stages { }" block
* Inside stages, define multiple "stage" blocks for different tasks
* Each stage should have "steps { }" containing commands

Sample Pipeline Structure:
* Stage 1: Pull code from Git (use "git" command with repository URL and branch name)
* Stage 2: Build/Compile (use "sh" for Linux or "bat" for Windows with compilation commands like "javac")
* Stage 3: Additional stages as needed (deploy, test, send email, etc.)

Using Pipeline Syntax Generator:
8. Click on "Pipeline Syntax" link at bottom of pipeline configuration
9. Select the action you want (e.g., "git" for Git operations, "sh" for shell commands)
10. Fill in the required details
11. Click "Generate Pipeline Script"
12. Copy the generated code and paste it in your pipeline script

Adding CI Trigger:
Add trigger block after agent:
triggers {
    pollSCM('* * * * *')  // for every minute, adjust as needed
}


Post-Build Actions (for CI/CD chaining):
13. Go to CI job configuration
14. Add "Post-build Actions"
15. Select "Build other projects"
16. Enter CD job name
17. Choose "Trigger only if build is stable"
18. Save configuration

Testing:
19. Save your pipeline configuration
20. Click "Build Now" or "Build with Parameters"
21. Check console output for execution details
22. View stage view to see pipeline flow
